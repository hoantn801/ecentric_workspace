# --- drift lock (#144, 2026-08-03) -------------------------------------------
# sha256 of the exact HTML this commit ships. Verified equal to the live

# sync after deploy returns "unchanged".
#
# upsert_web_page REFUSES to write (and changes nothing) when live hashes to
# none of the accepted values below. That is the whole point: several of these
# pages have been edited directly on the site in the past, and without the lock
# a stray call to the whitelisted sync endpoint would silently revert live to
# whatever the repo happened to hold.
#
# Deliberate update = edit the frontend source, bump BASELINE_SHA256 to the new
# sha, and move the value it replaced into SUPERSEDES_SHA256 -- all in the same
# commit. SUPERSEDES_SHA256 exists for repo-authored edits: at deploy time live
# still holds the bytes being superseded, and after the first successful write
# it holds the new snapshot; both are "not drifted", so both must be accepted.
